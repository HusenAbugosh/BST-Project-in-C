# BST-Project-in-C
project 3

In this project we will build an application to maintain information for school classes.
 For each of the students in a class, the following information is kept:
 a unique student ID,
 student name,
 home address (city),
 id of class he is currently in,
 and date of enrollment.

 For keeping track of the students, the school secretary would use a computer program based on a Binary Search Tree data structure.

we will write a program to help the secretary, by implementing following the following operations:

• Insert a student with all its associated data.
• Find a student by his/her student ID, and support updating of the student
info if found.
• List all students in lexicographic order of their names.
• Search for a city and list all students from that city in lexicographic order
of their names.
• List all students by their class in lexicographic order of their names.
• Delete a student given his/her student ID.
• Save all students in file students.data.
• Exit.
If file students.data exists, your program must automatically load its contents. This program should be interactive.
